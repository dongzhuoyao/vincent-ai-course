# Preface

Welcome to the AI Generative Models guide. This book serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various generative AI models that have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence in recent years.

## Purpose of This Book

This guide aims to provide a clear and concise overview of key generative AI models, with a focus on:

- **Diffusion Models**: Including DDPM, Stable Diffusion, and Consistency Models
- **Normalizing Flows**: Models that use invertible transformations
- **Flow Matching**: Continuous-time flow-based generative models
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Latent variable models with probabilistic encoders and decoders
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Adversarial framework with generator and discriminator networks
- **Auto-regressive Models**: Such as transformers used in large language models

Each section explores the theoretical foundations, architectures, and practical applications of these models, making complex concepts accessible to readers with varying levels of technical expertise.

## How to Use This Guide

The book is structured to allow both sequential reading and targeted exploration of specific models. You can:

1. Follow the chapters in order for a complete understanding of the landscape
2. Jump directly to specific model types that interest you
3. Use the reference sections to find original papers and additional resources

We hope this guide enhances your understanding of generative AI and inspires your own experiments and applications in this exciting field.
