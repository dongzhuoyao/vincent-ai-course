# Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model developed by Stability AI that generates detailed images from text descriptions.

## Architecture

- Latent space diffusion: applies diffusion in a compressed latent space
- Text conditioning: uses CLIP text embeddings to guide the generation
- VAE: encodes images to latent space and decodes them back
- UNet: performs the denoising in the latent space

## Key Features

- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image transformation
- Inpainting and outpainting
- Fine-tuning capabilities

## Applications

- Creative art generation
- Design prototyping
- Content creation
- Image editing
