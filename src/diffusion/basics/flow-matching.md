# Flow Matching

Flow Matching is a generative modeling technique that builds upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows and probability flow ODEs, offering an alternative training approach for generative models.

## Overview

Flow Matching defines a continuous-time transformation from a simple distribution (like a Gaussian) to a complex target distribution. Unlike traditional normalizing flows, flow matching doesn't require computing the Jacobian determinant, making it more flexible and computationally efficient.

## Key Concepts

- **Vector Fields**: Learning a vector field to represent the continuous-time flow
- **Straight-line Paths**: Using simple paths between distributions
- **Conditional Flow Matching**: Extending to conditional generation
- **ODE-based Generation**: Sampling by solving an ordinary differential equation

## Relation to Other Models

- **Diffusion Models**: Flow matching can be seen as a generalization of score-based diffusion models
- **Normalizing Flows**: Similar concept but with different training objectives
- **Optimal Transport**: Connection to optimal transport theory

## Advantages

- **Flexible Architecture**: No invertibility requirement
- **Efficient Training**: More efficient than score matching in some cases
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Well-founded mathematical framework
- **Stable Training**: Often more stable than adversarial approaches

## Applications

- **Image Generation**: Creating realistic images
- **Shape Generation**: 3D shape synthesis
- **Audio Synthesis**: Generating audio waveforms
- **Density Estimation**: Learning complex distributions
